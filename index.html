      <h1>A Look at Americans' Participation in the Arts</h1>

      <img src="images/top-chart.jpg" height=546 width=968.25 />

      <p>To many, America’s prime was when the arts were a thriving and fully-funded sector of society that had unwavering support from the government and the American people. However, the last two decades have shown the general population has been decreasingly involved in participating in any form of the arts. A study by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) classifies participation in the arts as attending concerts, music festivals, ballet performances, operas, musicals, and visiting museums.</p>
      <p> Many art historians believe that one reason for the decrease in participation is the increased backlash on funding the arts from Congress. However, this trend towards defunding the arts isn’t always direct. Cutting funds in education and subsidies also impact participation in the arts. For example, cutting education funds decreased the number of school field trips to museums, and reducing subsidies to cities that host major festivals and concerts has impacted how many cities host, if at all.</p>
      <p> This is not a particularly new trend. The arts were often first on the chopping block when Congress determined there needed to be cuts in federal funding. In 2011, Congress was on the verge of completely eradicating all funding to the NEA. In the end, the amendments for the legislation proposed were shot down, but a few art historians believe the attempt to remove arts from the agenda lead to a decline in overall participation. </p>
      <p> The chart above shows an increase in participation in the arts between 1982 and 1997 for almost all major categories. Since 1997, there has been a consistent decline in participation to today. One pivotal moment was a congressional cut in 1996, which resulted in nearly $100 million of funding being removed from the NEA. The ramifications were considered huge, as part of that defunding meant fewer field trips to art institutes and art fairs for public school students between K-12. </p>

      <p> Aside from a general decline in participation, the last two and a half decades have shown a prominent increase in minority participation across all major art sections. Although whites made up most of the participation in each category, blacks and other races have shown significant strides in jazz, musical and museum involvement. </p>

      <p> In terms of gender participation, the most interesting findings show a crossover in jazz participation between men and women. Between 1997 and 2002, women became the lead participators in jazz festivals and concerts and remained on top since. Additionally, in 1997 men overtook women in museum participation, only to fall a significant 6% the following period. </p>
      <p> No research has been connected between the 1997 gender trends and the congressional defunding to the NEA in 1996. </p>
